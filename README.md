## Summary of Findings
1. **Top reviewers tend to be elite users and write more reviews**  
Overall, top reviewers also seemed to have a more uniform distribution of star ratings across their reviews as opposed to more polarized ratings from the average user. For instance, review ratings peaked at whole and half numbers, especially one and five stars.
2. **Elite users tend to write slightly longer reviews**  
While elite users write longer reviews on average, the difference is minimal. This suggests that elite users may prioritize readability and being more concise when writing a review.
3. **Review writing peaks in summertime**  
Year over year, July seems to be the most popular month for writing reviews, suggesting users become more active during the summertime. This nods to the seasonality of user and even human behavior where individuals seem to dine out in warmer weather.
4. **Top compliments are mainly ‘cool’, however specific compliments may hold more meaning**  
'Cool' reviews may indicate what a good review looks like for Yelp users. On the other hand, it may also simply be a default reaction when users want to give a review a compliment. This nods to other compliments such as 'helpful' or 'funny' indicating sub-categorical review types.  
Although the 'cool' compliment was also the most popular for elite users, the distribution of other compliments was significantly more uniform.

## Recommendations
1. **Promote Intentionality With Review Writing**  
Review writing can be daunting for many as a lack of structure or call to action makes it hard to get started. Simply, many people might not even know what to put in their review. Thus by giving prompts or specific subjects reviewers can write about (i.e. 'What was your favorite dish?') may encourage more detailed and structured reviews. By encouraging quality in review writing through incentivications such as rewards or discounts, businesses may further benefit.
2. **Ramp Up Engagement During Summertime**  
With summertime being the most popular time for review writing, businesses can leverage this by increasing promotions and running campaigns during peak months. By capitalizing on the seasonality of user activity, businesses may benefit through capital as well as engagement on Yelp.
